    <h1><strong><u>MY AMAZING EXPERIENCE</u></strong></h1>
    <p><h2>First of all, for those of you that don't know what Shoprite is,
        <br>Shoprite is a general definition of a retail company or supermarket chain that operates primarily in Africa. It is one of the largest retailers in Africa, offering a wide range of products,
        <br>including groceries, household items, electronics, clothing, and more.
        <br>And my experience was like no other, well...</h2></p>
        <p>For starters, i could say that it was one of the best days of my life, i rolled and enjoyed alot of fun rides, and the dishes and snacks there
        <br>are life changing. Here are a few pics of my experience in Shoprite:</p>
        <p><h3>1. THE FUN RIDES I GOT INTO AND ROLLED FOR THE FIRST TIME</h3></p>
    <div class="funrides">
        <img src="funride.jpg" alt="Funrides" width="300px" height="auto">
        <img src="funride2.jpg" alt="Funrides" width="300px" height="300px">
        <h3>THE FERRIS WHEEL:</h3>
       <p>- It was a really fun but scary ride because it takes you round and round vertically that u can see the roof of Shoprite.
        <br>I really enjoyed it.</p>

        <h3>THE MARRY GO ROUND:</h3>
       <p>- It was a comforting and less scary ride because it takes you round and round horizontally.
        <br>I really enjoyed it.</p>
